// 3.Fence Usage:
//You declare VkFence vVkFence but don’t initialize it, and you pass it to vkQueueSubmit. Create a fence to synchronize submission:

VkFenceCreateInfo fenceInfo = {};
fenceInfo.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_FENCE_CREATE_INFO;
VkFence fence;
vkCreateFence(device, &fenceInfo, nullptr, &fence);

// In the main loop
vkQueueSubmit(queue, 1, &submitInfo, fence);
vkWaitForFences(device, 1, &fence, VK_TRUE, UINT64_MAX);
vkResetFences(device, 1, &fence);
