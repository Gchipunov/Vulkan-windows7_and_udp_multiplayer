Summary of Changes

    Fixed Shader Module Errors:
        Added vertShaderModule and fragShaderModule globals.
        Implemented readShaderFile and createShaderModule to load and create shaders.
        Provided example GLSL shaders and compilation instructions.
    Improved Pipeline Creation:
        Added proper vertex input state to match the Vertex structure.
        Ensured shader stages are correctly set up.
    Addressed Runtime Issues:
        Added framebuffer creation.
        Fixed command pool queue family index.
        Added fence for synchronization.
        Implemented swapchain image acquisition and presentation.
        Added validation layers for debugging.
        Included cleanup code.

Next Steps

    Create Shader Files:
        Write and compile the vertex and fragment shaders as shown above.
        Place vert.spv and frag.spv in a shaders directory.
    Enable Validation Layers:
        Install the Vulkan SDK and ensure validation layers are available.
        Update createInstance to enable VK_LAYER_KHRONOS_validation.
    Test the Application:
        Build and run the application.
        Use a debugger or validation layer output to catch any runtime errors.
    Add Transformations:
        To make the cube rotate or move, add a uniform buffer for a model-view-projection matrix and update the shaders to use it.

If you encounter any further errors or need help with specific parts (e.g., shader compilation, uniform buffers), let me know!
